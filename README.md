# Form a Story

This project is an interactive HTML-based form designed to collect user 
inputs and generate a customized story. The form gathers various types 
of information, such as text inputs, radio button selections, and 
dropdown lists, which are then processed using JavaScript to build a 
unique story for each user.

## Credits
This project is based on an exercise from 
<a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-forms">Codecademy</a>. 
While the task description, style.css, original.html, story.html and 
JavaScript files were provided by Codecademy, the HTML file (index.html) 
and its structure were fully implemented by me.
